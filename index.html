		<p1>The overall design of the aid is two simple L shaped poles. Each pole gets attached to a walker (the design is not a standalone product) using a clip/hinge 3d printed component. The short side of each L pole has a PVC grip handle that is positioned ideally away from the clip and over the other side of the L pole, doing this would move the weight from the vulnerable clip/hinge to the other steadier end of the short side of the pole which is resting on the long side of the pole. The long side of the pole rests on the ground and provides most of the support to the user's weight. The long side of the L shaped pole relates to the short side using a simple free moving hinge.

				I am from St. Catharines in the Niagara region, studying

				On my downtime I like to watch netflix and play League of Legends to let out some stress.
				I choose engineering because I knew it would be a rewarding and challenging achievement
				 and I reccently discovered my passion in programming. Although, there is so much I have
				learn, I am determine to make it through into my fourth year at Western.  </p1>
